# AUMS
Amrita university Management System is a web application that helps in tracing all the academic details of students. Each student is given a personal account for accessing and storing assignments, viewing attendence and viewing grades.

This is an android application that allows you to directly connect to the AUMS without having to painfully navigate through multiple web pages. 

This is an open source project and anyone interested in contibuting is welcome !
